----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This study titled ''Stylus in Anatolia from the 1st Millennium BC to the End of the Roman Imperial Period'' is the first comprehensive research on stylus in Anatolia. In ancient times, tools and equipment such as wooden tablets, papyrus, parchment, calamus, inkwell, tablet spatula, seal box were used in addition to the stylus. These objects are also mentioned in the study. In ancient times, the most common writing material in Anatolia is the stylus. Since papyrus, parchment and calamus are organic materials, it is not easy to understand by archaeological data how much they were used. The importance of stylus is that they can reach today more easily, therefore they provide archaeological data about writing materials in Antiquity. The study has aimed to reveal all the data that can be obtained about the stylus. There are three main topics when approaching the stylus. These are production techniques, stylus propagation and artifact place, formal properties. The stylistic features were also studied under three subtitles as analogy, typology and chronology, respectively. Thus, some conclusions were reached about relations among Anatolian finds and relations between Anatolian finds and the finds outside Anatolia. As the researches on writing materials increase in ancient times, knowledge about the literacy dimension of social life in Ancient Anatolia will continue to increase. In addition to the serious lack of information on this subject, writing materials are a subject with high potential in terms of increasing knowledge of Antiquity.
